# Summary
This is an Ansible dynamic inventory script for libvirt environment.

This script creates Ansible groups such as

- `VM_NAME` % `NETWORK_NAME`
- `VM_NAME` % `BRIDGE_NAME`
- `VM_NAME` % `VM_INTERFACE_NAME`

each group has only 1 IPv4 address which belongs to the VM on the libvirt network.

# Examples
## Case 1
```
$ ansible -i libvirt_dynamic_inventory.py vm01%default -m ping
```
returns an IPv4 address of `vm01` on `default` network.

## Case 2
```
$ ansible -i libvirt_dynamic_inventory.py vm01%virbr0 -m ping
```
returns an IPv4 address of `vm01` on `virbr0` bridge.

## Case 3
```
$ ansible -i libvirt_dynamic_inventory.py vm01%eth0 -m ping
```
returns an IPv4 address of `eth0` on `vm01`.

# Notes
On RHEL/CentOS, you should take care of PolKit (a.k.a PolicyKit) to run the script as non-root user.

First, create a rule file as follows (replace "ori" as your user name).
```
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
        if (action.id == "org.libvirt.unix.manage" &&
            subject.user == "ori") {
                return polkit.Result.YES;
                polkit.log("action=" + action);
                polkit.log("subject=" + subject);
        }
});
```
Then place the rule file in `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/`.
The rule file must have '.rules' suffix for its file name.
You might fix SELinux label for the rule file.
```
$ sudo restorecon -R /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/
```
